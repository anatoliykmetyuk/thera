I have numbers ${one}, ${ two } and ${three.four}. If I add them, here is what I get: ${  three-f}. I can also do ${fun_frag simple, nice} and ${fun_frag complex ,,
args,
awesome} calls. I hope to make $$1,000,000 on this stuff I can also call ${fun_frag ${fun_frag $$1,,000,,000, good}, recursive}.
