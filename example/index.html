title: This stuff works!
one: "1"
two: "2"
three:
  four: "4"

I have numbers ${one}, ${ two } and ${three.four}. If I add them, here is what I get: ${  three-frag}. I can also do ${fun_frag: simple, nice} and ${fun_frag: complex \,
args,
awesome} calls. I hope to make \$1,000,000 on this stuff I can also call ${fun_frag: ${fun_frag: \$1\,000\,000, good}, recursive}. We can also escape with "\\".
